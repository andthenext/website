# Website Briefing – And The Next

## 1. Overall Vision

Create a **graphically advanced, highly emotional portfolio website** that feels bold, confident, minimal, and future-facing.

The site represents **Dietmar Rietsch** and the ecosystem around **And The Next** – spanning entrepreneurship, investment, leadership, technology, design, and agentic systems.

The website should:

* Feel **premium, radical, and uncompromising**
* Be **entirely black** (true black background, no light modes)
* Use **beautiful, expressive typography** as a core design element
* Balance **strong minimalism** with **advanced visual effects**
* Communicate authority, vision, and humanity at the same time

## 2. Hero Section

### Hero Video

* **Asset:** `and-the-next.intro.mp4`
* Positioned as the **hero element**, immediately visible on page load
* Video duration: **30 seconds**
* Autoplay (muted), smooth fade-in
* After 30 seconds:

  * Video **organically fades out / dissolves**
  * Transition into the next section feels intentional and cinematic

### Animated Frame Interaction

* The video is surrounded by a **black frame**
* The frame is:

  * **Organic, fluid, alive**
  * Subtly animated based on **mouse movement**
  * Feels like a living boundary (not geometric, not static)
* Movement should be elegant, slow, and confident — never gimmicky
